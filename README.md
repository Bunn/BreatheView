Swift over Coffee challange

There are a couple things to make this better but since the challange had a one hour limit, this was the best I could do :)

- Apple's animation has a fade animation of a second layer of items when collapsing;
- Apple's animation has a blend on the layers (maybe the [plusLighter](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coregraphics/cgblendmode/pluslighter))
